## Overview

The Vehicle Telemetry System is a Unity-based project designed to monitor and display real-time vehicle metrics, including speed, engine RPM, gear position, transmission mode, and proximity to nearby vehicles. The system leverages the Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) package to provide accurate vehicular data and enhances gameplay through a comprehensive HUD.

## Features

- Real-time Metrics: Monitors key vehicle parameters such as:
  - Vehicle Velocity (km/h)
  - Engine RPM
  - Engine Status (On/Off)
  - Active Gear Position
  - Transmission Operating Mode (Automatic/Manual)
  - Proximity to the nearest vehicle (limited to 20 meters)
  
- Dynamic HUD: Displays live data in an intuitive heads-up display, providing players with immediate access to critical information during gameplay.

- Data Logging: Implements a system for logging telemetry data, with capabilities for exporting the data as a CSV file for analysis post-game.
